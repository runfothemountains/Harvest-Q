## Letter to the Judges

Dear Judges,  

This project began with a viral TikTok post that sparked a movement. Farmers and citizens across the U.S. engaged with the idea of creating a direct link between growers and communities — bypassing waste and barriers. What started as a conversation online quickly grew into a vision for **Harvest Q**, a platform designed to connect people with farmers in a simple, transparent, and legal way.  
Our mission is rooted in real voices. Farmers asked for a tool to sell directly. Citizens asked for clarity on what is legal to buy. Policymakers raised questions about compliance. Harvest Q brings those needs together in one solution — combining technology, community, and trust.
