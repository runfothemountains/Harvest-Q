## ✉️ Letter to the Judges

Dear Judges,  

This project began in an unexpected but powerful way. Earlier this year, one of my posts on TikTok went viral, sparking a wave of conversation about farming, food access, and community resilience. In the days that followed, I was contacted by associates of both a state governor and a congresswoman, who encouraged me to explore a software solution that could empower farmers and citizens alike. Their suggestion became the seed for what we are now building.  

What started as a simple concept—connecting people directly with farmers so they could buy fresh food—has since grown into something more comprehensive. As I engaged with experts and community voices, I discovered the layers of legal, logistical, and health considerations that shape how food moves from farms to tables. With these insights, we have evolved the model into **Harvest Q**, a platform designed to integrate agriculture, health, logistics, and technology while staying aligned with federal and state laws.  

- Documentation on how Harvest Q addresses farmer–citizen needs while respecting laws and contracts.

Thank you for your time, consideration, and for supporting innovation that can make a real difference for farmers and families alike.  

Respectfully,  
**The Harvest Q Team**
