Harvest Q â€“ Connecting Farmers to People
## Description
Harvest Q â€“ An AI-powered marketplace connecting farmers directly with people. Includes interactive demo
## Letter to the Judges

Dear Judges,  

This project began with a viral TikTok post that sparked a movement. Farmers and citizens across the U.S. engaged with the idea of creating a direct link between growers and communities â€” bypassing waste and barriers. What started as a conversation online quickly grew into a vision for **Harvest Q**, a platform designed to connect people with farmers in a simple, transparent, and legal way.  
Our mission is rooted in real voices. Farmers asked for a tool to sell directly. Citizens asked for clarity on what is legal to buy. Policymakers raised questions about compliance. Harvest Q brings those needs together in one solution â€” combining technology, community, and trust.  

We are honored to present this demo to you. Inside this repository, you will find:  
- An **interactive demo**

Respectfully,
